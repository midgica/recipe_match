convert_servings()
convert_units()









refactoring: 
	find out how ingredient amounts are currently being converted (line 322-340ish)
	use the for loop to put ingredient stuff directly in ingred_dict (line 295)
	add library for measurement conversion
	do i need an __init__.py?

features:
	allow user to convert how many servings they want
	forms to "upload" recipes
	database to store recipes
	html interface and persistent selection memory (google "html templates python")
	list of recipes when grocery list is displayed
	allow user to save a menu, shopping list, etc
	browse cookbook by category, not just alphabetical
	convert recipe to international measures

bugs: 
	when it says recipe object, make sure to return recipe.name instead of recipe (view menu, recipe match)
	inventory only allows one checkmark to change at once and i can't mark that i ran out of something
	shopping list isn't filtering out staples on hand
	can't X a recipe off the menu 
	ingredients to match with don't clear if you try to match again
